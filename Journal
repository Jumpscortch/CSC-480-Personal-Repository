October 7, 2018
Present: Raj Bhetwal, Augustine Maddox, Theodore Ryan

    Ted has begun contacting a few of the vendors we've found that deal with Islandora, since it's starting to look like the better bet for
the needs of our project. For now Raj is continuing to research DSpace, while I'm still looking into Islandora. Reggie has set up an AWS
account that will let us set up the servers we need to build our instances of the systems once we start working on them.

October 14, 2018
Present: Raj Bhetwal, Regenal Grant, Augustine Maddox, Theodore Ryan

    For the presentation on the 16th/18th, I've successfully set up the simplest version of the Islandora software, a virtual box
instancewhich is only accessible on my computer. We've had some difficulty with getting consistant attendance with all team members
(including myself), but generally we seem to be on track for the presentation. Ted has been in contact with a couple of vendors, and
we're planning to set up another meeting with our client, Amy, to discuss our progress and choose whether to continue to pursue DSpace or
not.

Present Raj Bhetwal, Regenal Grant, Theodore Ryan

    There was a miscommunication in arranging our meeting with Amy, which is mostly my fault. She has indicated to us that we should end
our consideration of DSpace, however, so we are focusing on Islandora.

Subject: RE: Islandora senior project research

 I am finishing up my senior year at Saint Martin’s and working on a senior project researching Dspace and Islandora as possible use to set up a repository for the University. I was wondering if you answer some questions about your library use of Islandora:
 
Do you hold space on site for servers to run it or is that on the cloud?
 No, it is not installed on site, it is hosted.
Did the library use a vendor to install and run it or is that managed by the yourself?
Yes, we used a vendor to install and maintain Islandora.
How does it handle for uploading data into the system? Easy or hard for users to add documentation?
 It is fine. The browser-based staff interface can be frustrating (and slow) but it works okay. The book content model in particular has given us errors and frustrations, but the regular PDF content model works fine and we also use the compound object content model pretty extensively. (The frustration with compound objects is reordering child objects, which is quite slow.) We have started using the video content model (we participated in a pilot that our vendor undertook) and it seems fine too.
If you use a vendor and able to say how much does it cost your library yearly/or pay out of pocket maintain the system yourself?
 I’m afraid I don’t remember what the annual cost is.
What additional systems other than listed on the Islandora page is required?
 I don’t think there is anything else that is required.
Your recommendation on using the system:
 I would recommend it – you either need staff and time to install and maintain yourself, or the budget to pay a vendor to do it (and just because it’s open source doesn’t mean that will be cheaper than a proprietary system) but overall I like it.
Pros:
 It is a robust system with an active community and development continuously happening, and even though we have a hosted system, we can benefit from the developments once they are vetted and available to customers of the vendor. There are multiple content models already available and it is flexible.
Cons:
Since it is hosted and because of how the vendor sets things up, we cannot access any theming or customization. We can only add or edit objects and object datastreams, but nothing on the Drupal side or command line. We can’t batch edit metadata that is already in the system (also a limitation of the hosted setup).

Answer from PLU:
Hello Ted Ryan,

I don't work closely with many of the users of the system, and I am not well versed in competing software systems.  I can't give you a good answer to the pros, cons, or total cost of ownership.  We host our installation on campus.  We host our own storage too.  I installed it, and maintain it.  It can be a little bit complex for some use-cases, but it is a fairly flexible system.  Installation is well documented, and shouldn't give you too much trouble if you are familiar with modern linux systems, tomcat, and apache.  You can probably get good answers to your questions from the mailing list. The main mailing list is at https://groups.google.com/d/forum/dspace-community

Presentation notes by Augustine:
Islandora 
Islandora is a digital repository system, meaning it is designed to both store and organize information. It is based on Fedora, Drupal, and Solr, among other software:
•	Fedora Commons is designed to have digital repositories such as Islandora built upon it. Its purpose it to instill a modular design into any software based on it. It is designed to allow for a digital repository to easily communicate information from one module to another. Modular design also allows for easy additions to the base structure, making growth a significantly simplified process.
•	Drupal is a content-management system, used as a web application framework for a lot of websites worldwide, and is written in PHP. While PHP is required for implementation of the system, no programming skills are necessary for basic website installation and administration.
•	Apache Solr is a search engine written in Java, based on the Apache Lucene project, which is an information retrieval software library. It is designed for scalability, and major features includes full-text search, hit highlighting, faceted search, real-time indexing, dynamic clustering, database integration, NoSQL features and rich document handling.
 
Pros (Strong):
•	It was designed initially by a college library system, the Robertson Library of the University of Prince Edward Island. It is also popular and used by many institutional libraries. Therefore, it is highly likely to be compatible with our requirements, as we are trying to emulate the original intent of the software.
•	Support for any file type (domain agnostic), which is useful generally, good for a library which stores multiple types of data, and good in our case when we don’t yet know the file types. It is also domain agnostic, meaning it
•	There is documentation for learning how to implement Islandora available from the Islandora homepage. With the goal of creating a system that is both easy to implement and simple to learn, this fits our needs very well.
•	Modular design is good for growth, as well as simplifying the learning process for future administrators of the implemented system.
•	Sandbox.

Other Pros (From Wikipedia):
•	Support for any file type (Fedora).
•	Multi-language and functionality support (Drupal).
•	A modular framework for defining specific data types, including standard audio, PDF, images, paged content, videos, and web archives.
•	Support for any XML metadata standard, including unique schemas.
•	Data-entry/editing forms for any XML schema.
•	Support for the creation of relationships between objects.
•	A flexible faceted search (Solr).
•	Automation of the transformation of assets.
•	Editorial workflows for approving submissions to the repository.

Cons:
•	Drupal is known to be less user friendly. This is somewhat mitigated by use of the Islandora format, but detailed maintenance of the system might still require knowledge of how to understand Drupal PHP.
•	It implements a lot of supplementary systems; at least passing knowledge of how they work is probably required, and it could potentially get confusing and convoluted.

 Dspace notes by Raj:
 USEFUL TIPS ON DSPACE REPOSITORY ARCHITECTURE
•	DSpace is well tested in a Linux, PostgreSQL environment.
•	Always run your repository with the latest software versions.
•	Putting Apache web server in front of Tomcat works well and makes the platform stable and possibly scalable.
•	If possible, use version control to manage your changes.
USEFUL TIPS FOR REPOSITORY BACKUP AND RECOVERY
•	It is important to have a Business Continuity Plan that covers backups/restore procedures and policies for disaster recovery.
For more information about repository preservation, check out this page on Gibson’s SUNScholar wiki.
 

Architectural Overview
DSpace is a set of cooperating Java web applications and utility programs that maintain an asset store and an associated metadata store. The web applications provide interfaces for administration, deposit, ingest, search, and access. The asset store is maintained on a file system or similar storage system. The metadata, including access and configuration information, is stored in a relational database.
Service Providers
DSpace has a global, active network of registered service providers who provided commercial support, hosting, training or site customization. https://duraspace.org/dspace/resources/service-providers/
Technical Aspects
Operating System:  Written in Java, tested under Linux, Windows, and Mac OSX
License:  BSD
Release version: 6.0, https://duraspace.org/dspace/download/
Documentation: https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSDOC/
Other prerequisite software: Java 7 or 8, Apache Maven, Apache Ant, Relational Database - PostgreSQL or Oracle, Servlet 3.0 container (Tomcat 7+ or similar).
Key Features
Application Architecture: DSpace is a full stack web application, consisting of a database, storage manager and front end web interface. The architecture includes a specific data model with configurable metadata schemas, workflows and browse/search functionality.
Modern, RESTful Web UI (coming soon): DSpace 7.0 will feature a completely rewritten web user interface based on the Angular 2 javascript platform.
Built-in workflows: Originally designed for libraries, the embedded DSpace data model and approval workflows are familiar to librarians and archivists.
Built-in search engine: DSpace comes packaged with Apache Solr, an open source enterprise search platform that enables filtered (faceted) searching and browsing of all objects. The full text of common file formats is searchable, along with all metadata fields. Browse by interfaces are also configurable.
Unlimited File types: DSpace can store any type of file. In addition, it auto-recognizes files of most common formats (e.g., DOC, PDF, XLS, PPT, JPEG, MPEG, TIFF).
Metadata: By default, DSpace uses a Qualified Dublin Core (QDC) based metadata schema. Institutions can extend that base schema or add custom QDC-like schemas. DSpace can import or export metadata from other major metadata schemas such as MARC or MODS.
Tools/plugins: DSpace comes with a suite of tools (batch ingest, batch export, batch metadata editing, etc.) and plugins for translating content into DSpace objects. Additionally, commercial plugins are available through service providers.
Security: DSpace provides its own built-in authentication / authorization system, but can also integrate with existing authentication systems such as LDAP or Shibboleth.
Permissions: DSpace allows you to control read/write permissions site-wide, per community, per collection, per item and per file. You may also delegate administrative permissions per community or per collection.
Disaster Recovery: DSpace allows you to export all of your system content as AIP (Archival Information Packages) backup files. These AIPs can be used to restore your entire site, or restore individual communities, collections or items.
OAI-PMH / SWORD (v1 and v2) / OpenAIRE / Driver: DSpace complies with standard protocols and best practices for access, ingest, and export.
REST: DSpace provides RESTful APIs in accordance with modern web standards.
Configurable Database: Organizations can choose either PostgreSQL or Oracle for the database in which DSpace manages items and metadata.
Configurable File Storage: Files in DSpace can be stored either using a local filesystem (default) or a cloud-based solution, such as Amazon S3.
Data Integrity: On upload, DSpace calculates and stores a checksum for each file. Optionally, you may ask DSpace to verify those checksums to validate file integrity.
Languages: DSpace is available in over 20 languages.
Software Development
Duraspace hosts a group of leading-edge open source projects characterized by thriving, consensus-driven, developer communities, including governance and membership, that strive to produce high quality products that insure sophisticated access and management of durable digital information.

Managing IPR
Where you are providing an institutional repository you will need permission from the IPR owner to do the things necessary to store, organise and manage the repository.

This can be done with a deposit licence, which is a standard agreement between the person depositing material in the repository and the institution running it.

It gives the repository the permission to make copies of the work and distribute them via the internet as well do what is necessary to preserve the work. It should also include a declaration from the depositor that they are the copyright owner or have the permission of the owner to deposit the material.

Hi Ryan— 

Thanks for your message. Here’s a general response to your query. Let me know if you’d like to follow up with more details about your requirements. If so, please feel free to schedule a time using my Calendly link.

1. Set up and Installation
Our base cost for setup and installation of Islandora 7 along with standard, community supported solution packs on a client-maintained server is $3600 + HST. 

This assumes that the client’s institution provides access to a system administrator to facilitate server access and the like. Any institutional branding and theming of the repository would be an additional cost, and these design services can be quoted for you once we have a better sense of the specific system requirements and information architecture for your institutional repository.  Our rates for custom design work are $150/h or $1200 per day.

2. Annual services agreement for Islandora. 
Includes the equivalent of 40 developer hours (at an agency rate of $150/h), with 24 allocated to general maintenance, security updates, and backups, and 16 to minor feature development.
A retainer for services will be billed in advance, with reconciliations done on an annual basis. Any budget remaining at the end of the year will be rolled over to the following year and documented under a new agreement. Reports on services will be issued quarterly.
Includes regularly scheduled general maintenance, security updates, and monthly data backups (client must provide server space for backups). Agreement covers incidental, routine and minor tasks, generally defined as tasks estimated to take 2 work hours or less to complete. May include requests for minor feature development. Tasks estimated to take over 2 hours will be negotiated separately with the client unless it is mutually agreed to apply the required work time to the agreement. Maintenance does not cover server hardware, configurations, or administration, which is the domain of the client’s web host.
40h @ $150/h = $6000 + HST per year

Best wishes

Hello Ted, 

Thank you for reaching out to us here at discoverygarden.  

I am the Business development manager for Discoverygarden inc. discoverygarden develops Digital/Institutional Repository systems for high profile organizations around the world using the award-winning Islandora Open Source software framework. Discoverygarden, as a contributor, has committed over 95% of the open source Islandora code which is used freely by organizations wishing to store, share, and preserve their important digital content.
 
Our client list includes such notables as UCLA, Vanderbilt University, The Hagley Museum, The University of Iowa, University of Connecticut, San Diego State University, Northern Illinois University, Caltech, Boston College, Atlanta University Center, The University of Sydney, Kansas City public library, San Francisco Public library and many, many more.

Before providing you with a general quote, I have some questions:

Is this a new repository or are you migrating content from an existing system?
What type of content are you storing?
How much content (GB,TB) are you anticipating needing storage for in year 1?
Are you interested in a vendor providing hosting services for your repository?
Do you have any documented requirements you could share?

Thanks,

Adam,
 
I apologize for the delay. Here are some answers for you:
 
Is this a new repository or are you migrating content from an existing system? New repository
What type of content are you storing? Images, videos, sound files, various documents in formats of excel, PDF, and .doc , and some programing files possibly initially
How much content (GB,TB) are you anticipating needing storage for in year 1? I would say plan estimate of 1.5 TB max with chance of reduction. Talked to local institution about same size and private and they have a 1.25 TB and only use about 40% so far of that space.
Are you interested in a vendor providing hosting services for your repository? Possible quote for both hosted services and just set up services with training
Do you have any documented requirements you could share? Not at this time.
 
Let me know if this is enough to go on thank you.
 
Respectfully
