Joined the Group. We are considering working with O'Grady Library to design a repository system for them.
They have recommended we look at two open-source methods, Islandora and D-Space. I am doing preliminary research on Islandora.

We met with Amy Steward-Mailhiot, our client. She gave us some basic specifications of what kind of project we are doing, the scope.

9/20/18, B
We met in class. It looks like we're doing a joint project. Our group will plan out and advise on the design; implementation will be a second group.

9/25/18
We continued to do research on the systems. Islandora is looking like a better fit, but we're going to attempt to implement both.
We need to consider how to implement the system, what kinds of software need to be installed, and how to run it.

9/27/18
We came together and decided we needed a better idea of what course to advise the library on before we meet with them again.
We will likely wait a week and then schedule a follow up meeting with Amy.

10/2/18
We did not accomplish much this week, so we are pushing back our goals by one week.
